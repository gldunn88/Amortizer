# Solution Architecture

## Technology Stack

We have selected the following technology stack for this project:

- **Frontend Framework:** React (latest version)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **UI Library:** (To be determined, e.g., Material UI or Chakra UI)
- **Hosting:** Static site hosting (e.g., AWS S3)
- **Platform:** Web, with a focus on local execution and static hosting

**Justification:**
- React is widely used and aligns with current professional experience.
- TypeScript provides type safety and maintainability.
- Vite offers fast development and build times, and is optimized for modern web projects.
- The stack supports interactive, graphical, and input-rich browser applications, and can be extended to mobile or desktop if needed.
- All data will remain client-side to meet security requirements.

Further architectural decisions will be documented in this file as the project progresses.
