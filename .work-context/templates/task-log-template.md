# Status
The status block will always prepend the log with the current work in progress. It is divided into active subtasks for logical separation.

## <Subtask Name>
- ⏳ <Task 1>
- ⏳ <Task 2>
- ⏳ <Task 3>

# Accomplishments
This section contains a high level summary of each major subtask completed. The specific line items are no longer relevant and may be removed once the summarized subtask is placed in this section.

# Logs
The logs should be updated in newest to oldest order. The items at the end of the list are for historical reference only, and lose value over time elapsed. Avoid verbose technical artifacts as they will age and are subject to change. Focus on work and impact done. Assume that details are hosted elsewhere.

## YYYY-MM-DD <Task Log Title>
