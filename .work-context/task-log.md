# Status
The status block will always prepend the log with the current work in progress. It is divided into active subtasks for logical separation.

## Project Scaffolding
- ✅ Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project
- ✅ Set up project directory structure
- ✅ Configure Vite for static site output
- ✅ Add README and initial documentation
- ✅ Record technology stack in solution-architecture.md
- ✅ Set up version control (git)
- ✅ Verify local development environment
- ✅ Stub page loaded locally

# Accomplishments
- Project scaffolding completed: React + TypeScript + Vite initialized, directory structure organized, static site config set, documentation added, version control set up, and local page verified.

# Logs
The logs should be updated in newest to oldest order. The items at the end of the list are for historical reference only, and lose value over time elapsed. Avoid verbose technical artifacts as they will age and are subject to change. Focus on work and impact done. Assume that details are hosted elsewhere.

## 2026-01-02 Project Scaffolding Complete
All scaffolding steps finished. Local development server verified with stub page loaded successfully.

### Detailed Notes
- Verified local page loads via Vite dev server
- Ready to connect local git repo to remote GitHub repository

## 2026-01-02 Project Scaffolding Progress
Initialized React + TypeScript + Vite project in app/. Created components, pages, and utils directories. Configured Vite for static site output.

### Detailed Notes
- Ran Vite scaffolding in app/ subdirectory
- Created src/components, src/pages, src/utils for code organization
- Updated vite.config.ts for static hosting
- Next: Add README and initial documentation

## 2026-01-02 Initial Project Setup
Established project direction and selected technology stack (React + TypeScript + Vite). Prepared initial documentation and outlined project scaffolding steps.

### Detailed Notes
- Documented technology stack in solution-architecture.md
- Defined project scaffolding steps in task-log.md
- Next: Begin project scaffolding and initialize repository
